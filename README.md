# JADE-container-examples

## Overview

This example repository contains various examples that show how to use JADE containers to stand up a variety of application environments. Each example has a README that explains how to deploy and run the example in a step-wise fashion as well as a single script that can be run to deploy a fully operational example environment on a laptop, PC, bare metal server or in the cloud. The repository also contains documentation on how to get started using Docker Desktop for Windows and provides a script to automate the setup process.

Note: The examples in master branch have been updated to use JADE version 2022 container images. Use the v2020 branch if you need 2020 examples.
